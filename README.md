# Goal

Create a React application that retrieves and displays the user repositories and organisations in Github.

## UX/UI

It should include an input to enter the username, one area to display the repositories of the user and another
area to display the organisations.

## Retrieving data

To make things easier we have commited a github-api.js file with the REST APIs needed to retrieve the information.

## Bootstrapping the project

Use whatever tools you like. This project is equal parts about evaluating your skill and learning about your
prefernces and style.

## Submitting the solution

Fork this repository under you user and work on the solution there. It should be clear how to build and run the
project locally. Once you have completed your work send an email to the team member who do the project
introduction letting them know you are ready for review.

## Evaluation

Your work will be evaluated for functional completeness based on the above stated goal. Additionally it will
be reviewed with the following criteria in mind:

* Project structure
* Workflow practices
* Implementatio choices

A follow-up code review will be provided after the project is submitted where the candidate will be asked to
provide any insights regarding their choices and practices.

## Bonus (don't need to be in the below specific order)

* Add an indicator when information is loading
* Deal with errors coming from Github
* Provide unit and integration tests
* Deploy the project somewhere
* Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await
